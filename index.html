        <h3>Question 1:</h3>
        <p class="question">What is direct access file organization? Describe its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Direct access file organization is a file organization technique where each record in the file is stored at
            a fixed location, determined by a unique key. The key is used to directly access the record in the file.
            <br><br>
            <span class="question">Advantages:</span>
            <br>
            - Fast retrieval of records: Since the records are stored at fixed locations, direct access files provide
            fast retrieval of records.
            - Efficient use of storage space: Direct access files do not require any additional storage space for
            pointers or indexes.
            <br><br>
            <span class="question">Disadvantages:</span>
            <br>
            - Limited flexibility: Direct access files do not support efficient addition or deletion of records.
            Modification of records is also limited.
            - Limited indexing: Direct access files do not support indexing, which can be useful for searching or
            sorting records.
